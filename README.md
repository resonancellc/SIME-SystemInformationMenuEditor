SIME was an attempt to do a WYSIWYG editor to design menu interfaces for touchscreen GPS Systems and PocketPCs running WindowsCE.

The tool was used to generate a serialized graphic representation in a  "INI" like format file which is used to generate a menu by the SystemInformation32 application.

SystemInformation is a free german software by [ultimatelaunch.de](http://www.ultimatelaunch.de)

It was a pretty good exercise writing javascript, everything was built from scratch, no jQuery or other fancy libraries. It uses only javascript css3 and html5 techniques, and there's no server side part.

Unfortunately I never managed to get it completed, but I hope I will get it done someday.

The source code is not minified of obfucated, so feel free to check it out, and if you want to continue this or use it to build another thing maybe, drop me a note on my contact page or social networks.

The documentation for the launcher software can be found here [Ini-Beschreibung](http://www.ultimatelaunch.de/systeminformation/inibeschreibung.html) and here [Tutorial](http://www.ultimatelaunch.de/systeminformation/tutorial/tutorial.html), unfortunately texts are only in german, but you can use google for that.
